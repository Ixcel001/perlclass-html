<p>Arsenal FC is the best football club in the entire world. The players are playing good football. Mikel Arteta has changed the perseption of the fans to the football club. He took the club from a pit of shame and they are now fighting to win trophies. I really like Arsenal football club. </p>
<p> The Arsenal players are Raya, Calafiori, White, Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Partey, Rice, Odegaard, Merino, Nwaneri, Jorginho, Saka, Havertz, Martinelli, Sterling, Trossard, Jesus and Tomiyasu.</p>
<p>Arsenal FC will indeed win the premier league this season.</p>
